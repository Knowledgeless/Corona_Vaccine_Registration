# Corona_Vaccine_Registration
<br><br><br>
    <p>
        I have tried to write a code about vaccine registration. There has lot of things predefined but code will pick them randomly. I have written this code/project during the pendamic situation. 
    </p>
    <h4><li>What are the features?</li></h4>
    <b>=></b> Lol, there are no features of course. Cause it has written on pure python code.<br>
    <h4><li>Will it send me email if my registration recorded successfully?</li></h4>
    <b>=></b>Nice Idea! I will look forword to it.<br>
    <h4><li>Is it going to call me to be vaccinated on that day I got by the code?</li></h4>
    <b>=></b> No, f***ing dumb a**. It's code, not your girlfriend/boyfriend. You are still single and will die single.<br><br>
    <h5>HappyCoding..!</h5>
